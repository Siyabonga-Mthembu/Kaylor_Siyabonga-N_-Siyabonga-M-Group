    <h2> The Biblical Story, Rameses Exodus:gods and kings</h2><br>
    <p >
        An Ancient Egyptian art is an insight into the soul of an era that has log attracted people worldwide.
         Ancient Egyptian art tells stories of gods and goddesses, Pharaohs and ordinary people, life and the afterlife, 
         all linked together into a narrative mosaic. It is a reflection of a highly organized and strongly society that 
         extremely proud of its history. In the movie Exodus shows us that even if they have a clean plan for what they 
         are trying to do, they speak to their gods and send wishes unto them, and gods they serve were fruitful and faithful to them. 
          “The something else is in the battle, the leader will be saved and the savior will be someday lead”, those words came from the 
          lady priest of the Egyptian king when they were preparing for a battle, she was referring it to Moses and it truly happened to 
          fulfill what she was talking of. <hr>
    </p>

    <p>
        The Pharaoh was at the lead of a complicated social order in Ancient Egypt. Their artwork powerfully captures this social system, 
        with each placement indicating its significance and position. The sovereign of gods and goddesses in Egyptian life were symbolized 
        by their frequently life size representations. Since Pharaohs to be supernatural beings or entities in and of themselves. Their majesty 
        and divine right to rule were also emphasized. 
        According to Exodus the gods and kings, portrays that art was not produced for its own sake, whether it was to honor the gods,
         remember the deceased, or record historical occurrences, every piece had a function . To respect gods and ask for their assistance, 
         temples were decorated with massive statues and elaborate hieroglyphics.<hr> 
    </p>

    <p>
        The decorations of commonplace items in the Ancient Egyptian, shows how art and society were interconnected. Care was taken in the 
        creation of jewelers, pottery, and even furniture which frequently had symbolic or religious designs. This focus on beauty and details 
        in commonplace objects reflect to a cultural that embrace art as a way of life rather than merely a verse for expressing religion. <br>
Ancient Egyptians art also served as a medium of communication. Their writing system was widely applied in inscriptions that served as a record
 of the pharaohs deeds for future generations, a description of religious ceremonies and announcement of law<hr>

    </p>
    <p>
        The films, the prince of Egypt and Exodus: gods and kings, portray Rameses as the great king who had a famous military campaign, who was 
        truthful to himself, the people of Egypt, and also to their cultural system. They believed in ruling by power, criticism, enforcement 
        and slavery rather tan to unite with other religious nations.<br>
The bible and movies portray Rameses II as a racist and criticizer king you cares only about his own people and cultural system istead of trying to learn from other.
